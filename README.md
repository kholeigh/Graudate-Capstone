Adult Arrests in D.C.: A Data-Driven Analysis of Racial Disparities


Overview
This project explores racial disparities in adult arrests in Washington, DC, with a specific focus on the prevalence of simple assault arrests. Using publicly available arrest data, the analysis examines how factors such as race, crime categories, and geographic trends contribute to systemic inequalities. 

Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:

To analyze arrest trends in Washington, DC.
To highlight the prevalence of simple assault as the most common reason for arrests.
To provide actionable insights for policymakers and advocates to address inequities in the criminal justice system.
To use Washington, DC as a case study to explore nationwide trends in arrests and incarceration.

Key Findings
Racial Disparities: Black individuals are disproportionately represented in arrest data particularly for crimes such as simple assault.
Simple Assault Trends: Simple assault accounts for the largest proportion of arrests which highlights systemic challenges in addressing non-violent offenses.
Geographic Insights: Arrests are concentrated in specific areas of DC which suggest the influence of systemic factors.
Case Study Relevance: The trends observed in D.C. reflect broader national issues, making this dataset a valuable resource for studying racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system.

Visualizations

This project includes interactive visualizations created in Tableau to illustrate key findings, including:

Arrests by Race and Crime Category: Bar charts and line graphs showing racial breakdowns across offense types.
Trends Over Time: Line charts highlighting changes in arrest patterns by month and year.
Geographic Distribution: Maps pinpointing areas with the highest arrest rates.
Simple Assault Focus: Pie charts and bar charts delving deeper into arrest data for simple assault.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted analyses to identify trends, patterns, and disparities.
Machine Learning: Applied logistic regression (binary and multiclass) and propensity score matching to explore treatment effects and feature importance.
Visualization: Created visualizations in Tableau to present findings in an interactive and accessible format.

Next Steps
This project highlights the need for further exploration of systemic inequities in arrest practices. Future efforts may include:

Expanding the dataset to include national arrest data for broader comparisons.
Investigating the impact of socioeconomic factors on arrest trends.
Developing policy recommendations to address racial disparities in arrests and incarceration.
